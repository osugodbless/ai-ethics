## Part A: Build My Foundation (no AI first)

### Find or simulate a short example of model bias (e.g., gender, nationality, profession).

An example of model bias is the COMPAS race bias with reoffending rates. Thorough investigations showed that the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS), was far more likely to say black defendant would reoffend than a white defendant.

### Explain in my own words why that bias may exist.

This bias may exist because the historical data that the model was trained on must have been predominantly that of black offenders, and not really representative enough. It could  be because of personal bias that affected the kind of data that was fed to the model.

#### Propose one mitigation (data balancing, prompt phrasing, model choice).

One mitigation I can think of is to train models with completed and balanced data that is fully representative of the various groups involved.

## Part C: Critical Reflection

### What % did you complete before using AI?
80%

### Did AI replace your thinking or amplify it?

It only amplified it.

### Could you explain this to someone else without AI?

Yes I can.

### What did you contribute that AI couldn't?

The fact that historically, blacks have been arrested and convicted more than other races in the US.
