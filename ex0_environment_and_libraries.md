## Personal AI learning ethics commitment:
- I will use AI to:

    - Amplify my understanding

    - Challenge my assumptions

    - Explore beyond my current knowledge

    - Work faster after I understand deeply

- I will NOT use AI to:

    - Avoid the struggle of learning

    - Get answers I haven't earned

    - Skip building fundamentals

    - Replace my own personal thinking
