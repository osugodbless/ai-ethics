## Phase 1: Build Foundation (you first)
Active reading, self-explanation (close the doc), simple scenario design (5–10 devices) with your justification.

## Phase 2: Strategic AI Use
Test your understanding, explore edge cases with targeted questions, then validate.

## Phase 3: Real Application
Design a small smart-city network (1,000 IoT sensors, 50 traffic lights, 10 emergency vehicles). Decide protocols, justify choices, list failure points, then refine with AI feedback.

## Reflection:

% human judgment vs. AI contribution

Could you defend decisions without AI?

What will you still remember in 6 months?

Did AI make you sharper, or think for you?
